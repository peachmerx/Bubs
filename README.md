Second Project for General Assembly
- Bubs for babies is basically for mums who are interested in joining groups and checking out what products that other mums think worked for their little bubs and toddlers. 
- The idea is that mums can join or sign up and they can upload some products that they think can help other mums or also create an article/blog/story that they want to share where other mums can learn from. 
- When you are signed in you can acces the products area and edit/delete/add from the list.


## Work Plan
- started with a mind map (hand written)
    Pages needed for my website:
        - Home basic landing page
        - Toys (products section, just cerated one page for now)
        - Learn (should be where all the blogs/articles/stories shared by the members)
        - Log in where all emembers can acces their profile and upload/ share their ideas and products.
        - Join where all the mums can sign-up if they want to be part of the Bubs for babies community

    Coding language used:
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - Python
    - Flask
    - SQL

## Road Blocks with this project:
- Had some troubles with password_hash
- Sometimes my Virtual environment isnt working and had to reinstall everything
- Also took awhile for me to create the log in and password 

## Improvements needed for this project:
Coding:
- still need a better log in page that would stop user from just clicking back
- still need to add other products pages
- also have to organize the account page in terms of edit/delete/add products.
- finish the article/blog/story page
- last is a more inetractive design and layout for my website
